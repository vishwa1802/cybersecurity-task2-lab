# Cybersecurity Lab Setup – Task 2

This project shows the setup of a personal cybersecurity practice lab created in a safe and isolated environment. The main goal of this task was to understand how penetration testing labs are prepared and how basic security tools are used for testing and analysis.

## Lab Setup

- VirtualBox used for virtualization
- Kali Linux configured as attacker machine
- DVWA installed as vulnerable web application
- Network configured using:
  - NAT (Internet access)
  - Host-Only (isolated communication)

## Tools Used

- Nmap – for network and port scanning
- Burp Suite – for intercepting web traffic
- Wireshark – for packet capture and analysis

## Verification Performed

- Checked system IP configuration
- Tested network connectivity using ping
- Performed port scanning using Nmap
- Verified HTTP interception using Burp Suite
- Captured network traffic using Wireshark

- Wireshark capture

## Purpose of this Task

This task helped me understand:
- How to create an isolated cybersecurity lab
- Basic networking concepts (NAT and Host-Only)
- Practical use of common security tools
- Safe environment for learning penetration testing
